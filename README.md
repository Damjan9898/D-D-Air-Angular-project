# Flight Booking Web App

<p>This project, a personal <em>Angular JS</em> flight booking web application, was created using Angular CLI version 15.0.4. It combines Angular's <em>TypeScript</em>-based framework with a <em>PHP</em> back-end, and all data is managed in a <em>MySQL</em> database. A key feature is its <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa chatbot</a>, developed in <em>Python</em>, enhancing user interaction.</p>

## How to Run the Web Application

First, you need to install the node modules. Open your terminal, navigate to the main application directory and run this line:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you need to run the development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Run Rasa chatbot servers separately:

```bash
//Rasa chatbot is a separate app which interacts with Flight Booking app through sockets. They need to be activated through separate terminal.
```


Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) with your browser to see the result.<span><br><br></span>
